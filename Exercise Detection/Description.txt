------------------ About the Project ------------------

The project aims to classify images of hand-stands, push-ups, and crunches using image recognition techniques. The project involves several stages, including pre-processing, data preparation, and model training.

To begin with, the images are pre-processed to ensure that they are of uniform size, format, and resolution. The pre-processing stage involves several steps, including resizing, normalization, and conversion to grayscale.

For training the model, I have used various deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. We have also utilized the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, which is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and classify objects in real-time.

In addition, I have used various pre-trained models, such as DarkNet, to speed up the training process and achieve higher accuracy. I have also utilized various data augmentation techniques, such as cropping to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization capabilities.

The project also involves the use of various Python libraries, such as NumPy, OpenCV, and OS, to manage the image data, manipulate and preprocess the images, and visualize the results.

------------------ Problem Definition ------------------

Classification between Push Ups, Hand stands and Crunches using Image Classification.

------------------ Approach/Method ------------------

1. The images were loaded onto python.
2. The images were renamed according to the classes and were brought to a common format - jpg.
3. The people inside the images were cropped out using YOLO v5 Object Detection algorithm.
4. The cropped images were then turned to grayscale images.
5. The images at the last stage were reshaped to 300x300 pixels.
6. After the pre-processing stage, the images were trained on a CNN model.
